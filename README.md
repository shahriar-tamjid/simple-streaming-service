# simple-streaming-service
This is a simple streaming service project. The UI was inspired from the Disney Plus streaming service. In this project I've used React.JS for front-end and Firebase for back-end.

# Developer's Message
My name is Sharif MD. Shahriar Tamjid and currently I'm studying B.Sc (Hons) in Computer Science and Engineering at Notre Dame University Bangladesh.
I'm just starting to learn React and other intermediate concepts of JavaScript. So, this project is kinda stepping stone for me :)
