# simple-streaming-service
This is a simple streaming service project. The UI was inspired from the Disney Plus streaming service. In this project I've used React.JS for front-end and Firebase for back-end.

# Developer's Message
I'm just starting to learn React and other intermediate concepts of JavaScript. So, this project is kinda stepping stone for me :)
